# ExperimentationMonoRepo

Conventions

- use this repo as your workspace and migrate to separate repo when ready
  - advantages
    - people don't see your commit history
    - keep this repo private
- commits are of the form: "HearthstoneFormsApp: blah blah blah"
  - easier to keep track of separate projects when going through history
