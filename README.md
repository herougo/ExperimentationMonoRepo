# ExperimentationMonoRepo

A repo for working on various projects regardless of whether they look polished or not

Conventions

- use this repo as your workspace and migrate to separate repo when ready
- commits are of the form: "HearthstoneFormsApp: implemented X and test"
  - easier to keep track of separate projects when going through history
